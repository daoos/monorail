**Who Am I?**

I'm a developer living in Austin, Texas. I build front-end and Node.js projects with love ðŸ’•

Currently I'm creating several front-end Vue (and vanilla) components, tools, Node.js libraries, websites and apps to help people solve problems. If you enjoy my work please consider making a donation. My ultimate goal is to become a full-time open-source ninja.
